== Introduction

The Java EE 7 platform continues the ease of development push that
characterized prior releases by bringing further simplification to
enterprise development. It adds new and important APIs such as the REST
client API in JAX-RS 2.0 and the long awaited Batch Processing API. Java
Message Service 2.0 has undergone an extreme makeover to align with the
improvements in the Java language. There are plenty of improvements to
several other components. Newer web standards like HTML 5, WebSocket,
and JSON processing are embraced to build modern web applications.

This hands-on lab will build a typical 3-tier end-to-end application
using the following Java EE 7 technologies:

* Java Persistence API 2.1 (JSR 338)
* Java API for RESTful Web Services 2.0 (JSR 339)
* Java Message Service 2.0 (JSR 343)
* JavaServer Faces 2.2 (JSR 344)
* Contexts and Dependency Injection 1.1 (JSR 346)
* Bean Validation 1.1 (JSR 349)
* Batch Applications for the Java Platform 1.0 (JSR 352)
* Java API for JSON Processing 1.0 (JSR 353)
* Java API for WebSocket 1.0 (JSR 356)
* Java Transaction API 1.2 (JSR 907)

Together these APIs will allow you to be more productive by simplifying enterprise development.

* GlassFish 4 comes pre-bundled with NetBeans 7.4+ and does not need to be downloaded explicitly. But if you want to download GlassFish 4 then can do so from http://glassfish.org/[glassfish.org].


If you have downloaded GlassFish 4 separately or using a pre-installed version of GlassFish 4, then configure it in NetBeans IDE following the instructions in link:#AppendixA[Appendix A].
