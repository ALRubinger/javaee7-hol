== Troubleshooting

[qanda]
How can I start/stop/restart GlassFish from within the IDE ?::
In the “Services” tab, right-click on “GlassFish Server 4”. All the
commands to start, stop, and restart are available from the pop-up menu.
The server log can be viewed by clicking on “View Server Log” and
web-based administration console can be seen by clicking on “View Admin
Console”.

I accidentally closed the GlassFish output log window. How do I bring it back ?::
In “Services” tab of NetBeans, expand “Servers”, choose the GlassFish
node, and select “View Domain Server Log”.
