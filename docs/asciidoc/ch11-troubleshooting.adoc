== Troubleshooting


*11.1* How can I start/stop/restart GlassFish from within the IDE ?

In the “Services” tab, right-click on “GlassFish Server 4”. All the
commands to start, stop, and restart are available from the pop-up menu.
The server log can be viewed by clicking on “View Server Log” and
web-based administration console can be seen by clicking on “View Admin
Console”.

*11.2* I accidentally closed the GlassFish output log window. How do I
bring it back ?

node, and select “View Domain Server Log”.
